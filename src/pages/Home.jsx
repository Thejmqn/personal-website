          If you are reading this page, you probably already have a decent idea of who I am. Although if you don't,
          that is pretty cool. I am a Computer Science (yikes) major at the University of Virginia, Charolettsville. 
          I have some slightly unique hobbies, interests, and beliefs, so I will just be throwing whatever I think of onto here if you are interested.

          I am making this page to create a more free form website where I can express my thoughts and also show off some
          past projects. I think most social media platforms are a bit too restrictive in terms of the customization they allow,
          so I just decided to quickly put together my own page instead. I'll still be posting links to this page on some social media though.
