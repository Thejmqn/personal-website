        <h2>An All-American Avenue</h2>
        <p>It does not require much proof to say that everyone hates traffic. No one (I hope) enjoys sitting at endless traffic lights in gridlock, spending 15 minutes to go 2 miles. However, if I had to hazard a guess, I would say I hate traffic considerably more than most people. While I am not someone who goes into full road rage at the sight of a slow driver, I do get internally mad every time I am stopped at a ridiculous traffic light. Even a single red light on a drive is enough to make me get a little upset, just thinking about the minutes of my life wasted doing nothing. Unfortunately, this problem is only compounded by the fact that I live in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39zg3j38y0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most congested metropolitan area in the U.S.</a></p>
        <p>Out of the hundreds of highly congested Northern Virginia roads I have driven on though, none has consistently angered me more than Sudley Road outside of Manassas, Virginia. In fact, it has annoyed me so much that I have decided to devote this entire article to analyzing a single, four mile stretch of road in Prince William County, Virginia. For various personal reasons, I have had to drive down this road about twice a week, both ways, for the past three months, so I have become well-acquainted with it. Thus, I figured I would write a bit about this road, its history, and its problems.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sudley+Rd,+Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginning with its layout</a>, Sudley Road starts as a two-lane road near the center of Old Town Manassas and remains in Manassas City for approximately 2 miles. It then becomes a three-lane road as it enters Prince William County at the town of Sudley (shockingly), spending about 2 ½ miles as a “stroad” running through disgusting strip malls and huge parking lots. It then reduces to one lane and winds for another 2 miles through Manassas Battlefield National Park. Finally, it cuts through various small suburbs and farms for 5 miles before intersecting with Route 15 and Waterfall Road.</p>
        <p>For a bit of history, the name Sudley Road <a href="https://www.potomaclocal.com/2016/05/04/sudley-road-named-after-forgotten-sudley-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comes from the local town of Sudley</a>. The origin of the name of the town is disputed, but it likely comes from the <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=101436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearby Sudley Springs sulphur spring or Sudley Mills granary</a>, built in 1817. Of course, that just kicks the can down the road of where those two place names originated from, but this is getting far enough up topic anyway. Sudley Road was one of the original roads used to connect Manassas to the rest of Virginia, and suburban sprawl quickly developed around the vital avenue. Today, the road and its surrounding area is part of the <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/f2359a6a2e884f23afc73fac390fdca9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sudley Road Redevelopment Corridor</a>, which aims to “Apply best practices from successful redevelopment projects in the Metro Washington area, focusing on urban design, equity, and sustainability” to the Sudley area.</p>

        <h2>The Rural Road</h2>
        <p>With the history and layout out of the way, I will give my opinions on the good and the bad of Sudley Road and its design. To start with some positivity, the one-lane rural part of Sudley is a very fun drive, provided you are not stuck behind a truck going 25 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.luckstone.com/locations/bull-run-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LuckStone trap rock quarry</a> is right off Sudley, so there will frequently be heavy trucks and machinery driving to the plant. In my tour of Sudley Road seen below, I get stuck behind a cement mixer for about 4 minutes before it turns onto Gum Spring Road.</p>
        <p>The other major complement I can give Sudley Road is in regards to its historical preservation efforts. Throughout the one-lane road section of Sudley, there has been a significant focus on maintaining the appearance and historical legacy of the famous Manassas Battlefield. There are five historical stops along Sudley Road that tourists can exit onto to learn more about the Battle of Manassas. I stopped at Stop #5, the smallest one, and was pleasantly surprised with the amount of information located at such an out of the way area. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of Sudley Church. There are also trails through the battlefield that people are able to walk through for some fresh air.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the two positives of the rural route of Sudley Road also cause some serious drawbacks. Specifically, Prince William County’s respectable dedication to preserving Manassas Battlefield has led to extremely congested intersections along Sudley Road. Since the road cannot be expanded without damaging the battlefield, no major expansions have been made in recent years, even in areas where one would be very useful in reducing traffic. In particular, the intersection of Route 29 (milemarker 221.8) and Sudley Road is a cause of massive delays. Each cycle of the light takes approximately three minutes, so efficiency is key. Unfortunately, the layout of the intersection does not allow for this.</p>
        <p>The problem with the intersection lies primarily with the turn lanes. There are no right turn lanes on the Sudley part of the road at all, so any car turning right will be stuck waiting behind cars going straight for the entire duration of the light. In addition, the southbound left turn lane is extremely small, being only able to hold approximately three or four cars before blocking the main lane. This means two big trucks turning left can block the entire flow of southbound traffic for three minutes, causing a massive backup that can cause delays at this light to be up to 15 minutes. The southbound traffic can be backed up for almost a mile, and the northbound traffic for about half a mile. Due to the historic nature of Manassas Battlefield, it is unlikely the road will be expanded to add turn lanes.</p>

        <h2>Suburban Stroad Sprawl</h2>
        <p>While there were some positive things I could say about the rural part of Sudley Road, the same cannot be said for the “strip mall” part of the road. After exiting Manassas City, Sudley Road winds for two and a half miles through the town of Sudley. Despite this drive only being about two and a half miles, and there being no major road intersections, it still can take up to 15 minutes during rush hour headed northbound. The attached video below spends the first approximately 10 minutes in the strip mall part of Sudley Road, so I got lucky driving on Sudley that day. Still, a quick inspection of the video can show the problems Sudley Road, and many similar American roads, face today.</p>
        <p>The biggest planning lies with the city planning of the town of Sudley, if it can even be called a town. All the amenities of the town are built lazily along Sudley Road in the form of huge strip malls and shopping centers with massive parking lots. It is borderline impossible to safely walk between any two locations because everything is so spread out due to all the parking. Even if you tried to walk, many of the intersections do not have proper pedestrian crossings, so you would just have to chance crossing the six-lane Sudley Road on foot. Or, if you do find a pedestrian crossing, pressing the crossing signal to cross Sudley will cause a large traffic backup as an entire line of traffic waits for a single person to cross the road. It is a lose-lose scenario.</p>
        <p>Since it is impossible to walk and there are no alternative forms of transportation, driving becomes the only option. This, of course, increases traffic congestion, as anyone entering or exiting Sudley or Manassas is required to drive down Sudley Road. Inner Sudley Road also has a problem with turn lanes, similar to the Route 29 intersection. Many of the left turn lanes are not wide enough to accommodate all cars waiting to turn left, causing a potentially dangerous backup onto the main road. Also, most intersections lack a dedicated right turn lane, causing drivers turning right into a strip mall to have to dangerously slow down to about 10 miles an hour in a 45 mile an hour zone in order to make the turn.</p>
        <p>In a <a href="https://eservice.pwcgov.org/planning/documents/SudleyRoadTAP/Walkability%20Assessment%20-%20Sudley%20Road.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study conducted by the Prince William Department of Transportation, Sudley Road received</a> a 6/18 on walkability assessment checklist, designating the road as a “risky route for pedestrians,” the second lowest possible rating.  The road lost points for things such as “trash found everywhere,” “drivers not respecting pedestrians,” being “dangerous and challenging for pedestrians.” In a similar <a href="https://eservice.pwcgov.org/planning/documents/SudleyRoadTAP/Bikeability%20Assessment%20-%20Sudley%20Road.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bikeability assessment study</a>, the road received the lowest possible score of “Awful - 1” in every possible category, designating the road as “hazardous.” The study concluded that “The conditions are so adverse that bicyclists opt for riding on 4-foot-wide sidewalks.” Apparently, bicycle use was measured from November 25, 2024, to January 9, 2025, and only nine bicyclists were found in the entire one and a half month period. While I am not the biggest fan of bikes, at least some improvements could be done (although shoutout to those nine people).</p>

        <h2>The Future of Sudley</h2>
        <p>Is there a brighter future ahead of Sudley Road? To be honest, I highly doubt it. Many of the businesses along Sudley Road are generic and uninspired. By my count, there are somehow 14 gas stations along the 2.5 mile strip mall part of Sudley Road. The road also contains almost every fast food restaurant available, many abandoned buildings, multiple car dealerships, and huge parking lots for empty department stores. There simply are not too many inspiring buildings along the main part of Sudley Road before entering Manassas proper.</p>
        <p>As part of the county’s <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ea093ab38cdb425c8d29b14bbfaa97f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2040 Comprehensive Plan</a>, the Sudley Road area is classified as a redevelopment corridor, meaning it is “consisting of older commercial neighborhoods that lack full economic potential and are identified as a priority.” Thus, if the county’s plan comes to fruition, more exciting development could be occurring in the future. New road improvement projects are being proposed, such as the <a href="https://www.manassasva.gov/community_development/planning_and_zoning/sudley_road_centreville_road_roundabout.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction of a roundabout</a> at the intersection of Sudley Road and Route 28 in Manassas City. Until then though, if you are ever with me while I am driving down Sudley Road, don’t get scared if I get a little mad. Because if there’s one thing I hate, it’s pointless traffic.</p>
