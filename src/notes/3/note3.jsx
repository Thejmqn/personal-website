        <h2>A Minor Disruption</h2>
        <p>This week I was hoping to write a more uplifting note, such as one about my new cats. However, it is clear that we are in an era of political disruption, and events are happening lightning fast. What happens in the present, over the next few years, will be studied in the history books for hundreds of years. My belief in this idea of rapid change was only strengthened further when I found out on Friday that the President of my University announced his resignation, effective immediately. Jim Ryan, President of the University of Virginia, is now unemployed.</p>
        <p>Jim Ryan was involved in a dispute with the federal government and Donald Trump’s Department of Justice over his handling of the University’s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. It was clear that if he did not resign, Trump would instruct the federal government to cut off massive amounts of the University’s funding. He decided it was not worth the fight with Trump to keep his job and potentially lose funding, saying, <q>To do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld.</q></p>
        <p>There are already hundreds of other articles and posts online discussing the merits of diversity programs, and if Ryan should have stuck to his principles and stayed in his position to fight Trump. As a humble Computer Science and Engineering student, I am quite unqualified to discuss the merits of DEI in today’s society, and I will leave that for others who are more educated on the subject. However, I do enjoy looking into US history. So, I thought I would take an unbiased and historical perspective on this issue. I want to see if Jefferson and past UVA figures would approve of Trump and the DOJ’s decision to put pressure on Ryan and the University. The general argument from conservative media and alumni is that the DOJ’s pressure on Ryan would be completely supported by Thomas Jefferson, and therefore, Trump’s moves are justified. Let’s see if that’s true.</p>

        <h2>A President for All</h2>
        <p>An interesting, although not super relevant, technicality to start off with is the University was never intended to have a president in the first place. Jefferson originally structured the University to be governed exclusively by the Board of Visitors. For the first 80 years of UVA, there was no position of president at all. Instead, various high-ranking faculty members would be sworn in as University Executives and oversee different departments and tasks. Jefferson historically was opposed to having a single, powerful <q>strongman</q> leader that could resemble a king. For example, he <a href="https://time.com/4166680/thomas-jefferson-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to speak in front of Congress</a>, arguing it would look too much like a king. The no-president system ended in 1904 when <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/alderman-edwin-anderson-1861-1931/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edwin Alderman</a>, of Alderman Road fame, was sworn in as the first President of the University of Virginia. The previous system with multiple administrative leaders was deemed too cumbersome, so Jefferson’s original vision for a University without a President was discarded.</p>
        <p>So, with that footnote out of the way, let’s examine Jefferson’s opinions on the independence of public education. Jefferson, as almost anyone reading this will know, believed an educated populace was the key to the success of a democratic state. One of my favorite Jefferson quotes supporting this idea is, <q>If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.</q> Jefferson believed that a well-informed and intelligent citizenry would be fully capable of managing itself democratically and responsibly. This belief led to the formation of a core tenant of the University: Student self-governance by an educated student body.</p>
        <p>The tradition of student self-governance at the University of Virginia is a storied tradition that virtually every student and alumnus of the university holds dear. It brings the nation’s democratic and Jeffersonian principles down to the University level, allowing the students affected by the University’s decisions to have a say. UVA alumni organizations, <a href="https://jeffersoncouncil.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including those supporting Ryan’s removal</a>, support the principles of self-governance. Thus, an interesting question can be raised about the current situation: Under a model of student self-governance, should students have a say in who the president of their university is? While this question can be thoroughly debated, in my opinion, the answer is unequivocally a yes.</p>
        <p>Jefferson, of course, was in favor of popular elections and deciding rulers by the will of the people. In his <q>Notes on the State of Virginia,</q> he stated, <q>Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves therefore are its only safe depositories.</q> It is clear rule by the citizenry, or in this case the student body, is a core principle of the University and its founders. Organizations which claim to support student self-governance should also support a student-wide referendum on the subject of the University’s presidency. The President of the University should only be able to be sworn in or removed either by their own resignation or by an open and free vote of students. Virtually no students were consulted by the federal government or the Board of Visitors as Ryan was removed, violating this core democratic principle. If a vote was held, it almost certainly would have supported keeping President Ryan, <a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/06/this-is-not-what-students-want-students-react-to-ryans-resignation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likely by an over 3-to-1 margin</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Virginia Resolution</h2>
        <p>If the removal of President Ryan by federal forces cannot be justified by the structure of the University, what other common arguments are there? The most common contention is based on the University’s acceptance of federal grants. Ryan opponents argue that the federal government is justified in pressuring for his removal, since the University is a large recipient of federal research grants. They say that UVA, if it did not want to listen to the federal government, should simply not accept any funds. This seems to be a reasonable argument on a surface level; however, after deeper thinking the flaws in this idea should come up quickly. I find this argument to be particularly short-sightened and poorly thought out compared to other arguments made, and Jefferson would have as well.</p>
        <p>Jefferson was one of the most prominent opponents of federal intervention and centralization in his time. As the thought leader of a set of principles known as Jeffersonian Democracy, he advocated for a weak central government, due to its political distance from the people. He was the chief architect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions</a>, which went so far as to say that states had the right to completely ignore federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional. While these ideas are no longer an element of modern American political discourse, they do highlight how Jefferson felt about the federal government. He would undoubtedly be opposed to any sort of federal pressure put onto a state run University.</p>
        <p>The Jeffersonian critique of the federal government’s distance from the people is particularly relevant here. As explained earlier, it is clear the Trump administration is not in touch with what the student body of the University wants with regard to its president. If a fair election amongst the student population was held on whether to keep or remove President Ryan, it is all but guaranteed that Ryan would be kept in with a wide margin. His removal is undemocratic and in some senses can be viewed as a coup of the University leadership. However, this still leaves the argument that the University is accepting federal dollars.</p>
        <p>This argument seems to make sense on a surface level. After all, the federal government is the one who is handing out the money, so they should have some influence in where it goes. However, the problem lies in the fact that public universities, for all intents and purposes, have no choice but to be reliant on federal grants. Since World War 2 and the New Deal, the federal government has been steadily growing in power, to the point where today the entire economy is dependent on it. The education sector is no exception to this rule. Accepting federal grants is not optional because the nation has become so centralized that state and local money will never be enough to fund universities. Conservatives generally argue that this centralization is a net negative for the country and that state’s rights should not be infringed upon. Thus, it is confusing that they are now pressuring a state university to change its course of action by applying federal pressure.</p>

        <h2>President Bennett </h2>
        <p>Now that Ryan is removed from office, one question remains: what, and who, is next? Per University policy, Executive Vice President Jennefier Davis will become acting president. She will maintain this role until an interim president is named, who will then hold the role until a permanent president is named. I find this system a bit silly given that there is currently an interim interim president in charge, but that is beside the point. The Board of Visitors will need to search for the next leader of the University. There are very few candidates that will make everyone happy, given the political differences between the Board, the federal government, the Virginia government, and the student body.</p>
        <p>The appointment is very likely to be influenced by the upcoming gubernatorial election in Virginia. In fact, it may become a major campaign issue in the governor and attorney general races. The governor has the power to appoint and dismiss members of the Board, so whichever party wins the Governor election will have control over who the next president is. If the Board tries to name a President before the next election, I could see the President being removed by the incoming governor. Thus, I find it likely that there will be no president at all for the current academic year. It seems like nobody is going to win in this scenario, just as politics tends to play out.</p>
        <p>There is only one person I could seriously see being supported by everyone, and I am only half joking when I say this. You read the header title, that is correct, it is the legendary Coach Tony Bennett. He has stated he wants to maintain a role in the University after his departure from coaching, and I could see this being the perfect role for him. He is supported by students, alumni, and faculty alike. Of course, his academic background is not as impressive as Ryan’s. However, he is an intelligent and extremely well-liked Cavalier who would command respect from all sides. I cast my vote for President Bennett.</p>
        <p>So would Thomas Jefferson support the federal government removing President Ryan? Unfortunately for us, Jefferson died 199 years ago, so unless the Biomedical Engineers invent a new form of resurrection, we will never know for certain. Oh well\!</p>
