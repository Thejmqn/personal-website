        <h2>Little League vs Major League</h2>
        <p>Last weekend I was at two different baseball games, of slightly different quality and performance. On Saturday, I went to D.C. to watch the Washington Nationals play the Texas Rangers. Then, on Sunday, I went to Reston to watch my eight year old cousin play Little League ball. No offense to the Nationals, but I found the Little League game, with actual eight year olds, more exciting than the professional game. I am not usually someone who says that baseball is a boring sport, and I generally think that people are misinformed or uneducated when they say that. There are a lot of subtle and strategic moves that I enjoy watching in baseball, and the overall chill vibe is also something that I also appreciate. However, this game against the Rangers proved to be about as boring as I could imagine.</p>
        <p>The starting pitcher for the Rangers was <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/degroja01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob deGrom</a>, one of the best and most underlooked pitchers of 2025. As of writing, his ERA is only 2.07, which is in the top 10 lowest for a starting pitcher. Needless to say, this contributed to a horrible hitting performance from the Nats, who only had three meaningless hits the entire game. What was particularly brutal about watching the game was that the Rangers scored two early runs in the first inning, so the Nats did not even seem to have a chance of winning. The Rangers eventually won 5-0, and I went home feeling like I had wasted my time. There was one interesting thing that came out of the game, though. My friend next to me said something along the lines of, <q>This is the most boring game I’ve seen in awhile.</q> And that got me thinking, what was the most boring baseball game ever, and how does this one stack up?</p>

        <h2>Avoiding the Extremes</h2>
        <p>A quick Google search for <q>most boring baseball game</q> yields surprisingly few results, as seemingly no one has tried to answer this question before. Trust me, I scoured the Internet far and wide - I even went to the second page of Google. The only game that seems to be discussed sometimes is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings#Longest_games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1968 game</a> between the Mets and Astros that went scoreless through 24 innings. Here’s the thing though: In my opinion, a 24 inning scoreless tie is actually a pretty interesting and exciting game. While it is not the most exciting, at least the game is close and everyone watching knows that a single play could end the game at any point. To me, that sounds more like a nail biter than a snoozefest.</p>
        <p>Thus, when looking for a boring game, we need to avoid <q>extreme cases</q>. On one side, I think most people would agree a high scoring 15-12 baseball game is not boring. I would also say a 15-0 baseball game is still at least somewhat interesting, at least for one side. On the other side, I would still argue a 2-0 or 1-0 game is interesting, especially if the only runs are scored late in the game, and both sides are getting runners on base. Fans watching this game would still be on the edge of their seats, knowing the go-ahead run could be coming at any time.</p>
        <p>A game that is truly in contention for the most boring game of all time needs to have none of these aspects discussed. It needs to have a few runs scored, but not too many. The runs scored need to be at the start of the game so the rest of the game feels meaningless. The losing team should have few scoring opportunities so nobody gets too excited. And most importantly, there needs to be frequent events that slow down the game, such as pitching changes, video reviews, and mound visits. Not only should the game be over by the 3rd inning, but fans who stick it out should be forced to suffer through a slog of constant 5-minute pitching changes.</p>
        <p>All of this being said, there is still one aspect that a boring game needs to have: there needs to be no possibilities for unique stats. While the losing team needs to be way behind and have no hope, they should not be getting no-hit. A no-hitter is inherently special, and will go down in the record books as an interesting game to review in the future. While the winning team should be ahead, they should not be so far ahead that the score becomes notable for how much they won by. The perfect game for our test of boringness needs to have no interesting qualities, and no extreme events. It should be perfectly unmemorable, and be perfectly boring.</p>

        <h2>Creating a Formula</h2>
        <p>To find out the most boring game, we first need a rough formula to assign a <q>boring score</q> to each MLB game that has happened. To make this formula, I took into account various statistics for each MLB game, and assigned them a multiplier based on whether they make the game more exciting or less. For example, for each mound visit in a game, the boring score increases by 0.3. On the other hand, each lead change decreases the boring score by -3. There were about 25 stats included in this measurement ranging from small annoyances like the number of video reviews used, to major slowdowns like the number of pitching changes.</p>
        <p>There were also some slightly more subjective measurements. I took into consideration factors like the total game attendance, as I generally believe more fans at a game makes the game more exciting. I also gave games a penalty as they became more meaningless to the final standings of the league. For example, a game between two 50-100 teams at the end of the season will incur a drastic increase to its boring store due to the lack of importance of the game to the season. All the factors and their effects on the boring score can be seen in the GitHub repository for the project.</p>
        <p>After making the formula, the final step was to implement the changes. I used the publicly available <a href="https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/baseballStats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLB API</a> to get the necessary data for the games, and began programming the formula I came up with. I decided to use Python because there was already an MLB API wrapper package available, but it ended up not working very well so I didn’t end up using it. It took about an hour to program all the stats in, and then began running through games. Unfortunately, due to limits of my own time and the MLB API, I could not run through every game ever, so I just decided to score each game of the 2024 regular season. This still provided over 2000 games to look at though. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Thejmqn/boring-baseball/blob/main/main.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Game of the Year</h2>
        <p>After running through all the games of the 2024 season, the three highest scoring games were <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ANA/ANA202409180.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Sox at Angels</a> with a boring score of 47, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TBA/TBA202408300.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Padres at Rays</a> with a score of 45, and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK202407040.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angels at Athletics</a> with a score of 44. To be honest I am a bit surprised that the White Sox at Angels game scored so highly given that it went to extra innings and the game was relatively close. However, the first nine innings only had two runs scored, and the game incurred a massive penalty due to being between two very bad teams at the end of the season. There were also a horrific 15 pitchers used and 11 mound visits, causing the game to last over three and a half hours. The Padres at Rays game also took three and a half hours and was a blowout.</p>
        <p>I am going to give the most boring game award to the Angels at Athletics game though. Despite not having the highest score, it has everything you could ever ask for when it comes to the ideal boring game. A game between two terrible teams playing at this point for almost nothing. A mostly empty Oakland stadium. 10 pitchers used despite being a shutout game. A 5-0 final score with only eight hits the entire game, with the A’s getting an early lead they kept throughout. And most importantly, absolutely no notable stats from either team coming out of this game. There is really nothing to talk about when analyzing this game, and that is why it is so perfect.</p>
        <p>To end off with a little bit of positivity, because baseball is actually an exciting sport most of the time, the three most interesting games according to this scale were <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/COL/COL202406190.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dodgers at Rockies</a> with a boring score of -10, <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SDN/SDN202404280.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phillies at Padres</a> with a score of -13, and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN202406140.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royals at Dodgers</a> with a score of -16. The Royals at Dodgers game in particular is interesting as it only lasted 2 hours and 1 minute in total, with just 6 pitching changes despite being such a close game. It also benefits from being a Dodgers home game with massive attendance. All of these games are good contenders for the least boring game of the 2024 MLB Season.</p>
        <p>So what did I learn from this experiment? Honestly not much. But it was pretty fun, so that’s what matters. In the future, I could modify my program to try and predict what future games will be interesting, which could be a more useful program so people can see which games they want to attend. By the way, the Nationals game that I attended ended up with a boring score of 27. So while it was very boring, it was not even close to being the most boring game I could have attended. So there is a great thought to end this off with.</p>
