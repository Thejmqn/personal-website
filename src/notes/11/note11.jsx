        <h2>The Parking Lot Subsystem</h2>
        <p>Any good systems engineer should be all-too-familiar with the supposedly magical term “subsystem.” As someone who has worked both in University and in the workplace with many systems engineers, the word “subsystem” gets thrown around all the time when developing or analyzing a larger system. Any component of the system? Subsystem. A system plugin? Subsystem. Anything already built you don’t understand? Call it a subsystem. Software that you would like to develop, but have no idea how you could possibly do it? Say some other subsystem will handle the problem. I had previously decided that the word had lost all meaning, especially when the system that is supposed to be above the subsystems is vaguely defined. However, I have recently had an extremely dull experience that, despite its tedium, made me think more about the role of subsystems, not just in systems and software development, but in real life.</p>
        <p>Every Monday and Wednesday, at the conclusion of my 3:30-4:45 class on Smart Buildings in the University of Virginia’s Rice Hall, I pick up my car from my purchased parking spot about a ten-minute walk away from Rice Hall and about a fifteen-minute walk away from my apartment. I talked ad nauseam why I have such a ridiculous and far away parking spot in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h0vC_tdmz4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marching band video</a>, but the point here is that I usually take the bus after my Smart Buildings class to my car, and then drive my car back to my apartment and park it underneath a nearby University-owned building. The problem I face is that I only have permission to park in the lots nearby to my apartment from 5:00pm to midnight on weekdays, and all day on weekends. This means that every single weekday evening I must move my car to my designated parking spot, take the bus back home, then bus back to my car after class the next day. You can consider this a failure of the parking and transportation subsystem of the University at large, but I try to make it work.</p>
        <p>This Monday, my class ended exactly at 4:45, and I rushed out to be able to get on the bus on time. It usually leaves the nearby bus stop at 4:49, but the schedule seems to be quasi-random, and I have not been able to fully determine when or why it leaves at certain times. This day, I got on the bus at 4:48, and it left exactly at 4:49, making my timing impeccable. While on the bus, I ordered a nice pasta dish over the phone from the nearby University-owned restaurant that is above the parking garage where I park. At 4:56, I got off the bus at my parking spot, then drove my car to my apartment, where I parked at precisely 5:01, right at the legal parking time. I then received a notification from my phone that my pasta was ready, so I took the elevator up to the food hall, picked up my pasta, and got back to my apartment at 5:05. This may seem very mundane, because it is, but I was very proud of myself for perfectly interplaying multiple subsystems to make the most of a suboptimal parking situation.</p>

        <h2>The Coughing Subsystem</h2>
        <p>In a very nerdy way, I like to think of the human body as a fully functioning system, and the individual parts of the body as a subsystem. The systems engineers and the biologists of the world may agree or disagree here, but I find it to be a useful comparison. There is an interesting point of contention here that can vaguely be related to treating the human body as a system: Does feeling sick, injured, or otherwise unwell temporarily make a person better appreciate feeling healthy? In his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qzDhGLx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Why Die?”</a>, CGPGrey would contend that this is absolutely not the case. Would you torture someone to make them better appreciate the pleasures of life when they are not being tortured? You would certainly be considered a societal monster for doing so. However, a friend of mine who has had serious health complications in his left leg, when I discussed this with him, said that he appreciates being to walk much more now that he is recovered than from before he was sick. I will give my opinion with a personal anecdote.</p>
        <p>About five weeks ago, I was sitting in my Database Systems class when I began having some searing pain in the side of my mouth. I tried to ignore it for the rest of the day, but when I woke up the next morning, the pain had gotten so bad that I was barely able to open my mouth to eat. I took over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine for the first time in years, since the pain was so intolerable that I could not focus on normal tasks. The pain was caused by my bottom left wisdom tooth erupting, and a quick WebMD search said the pain should only last for about 4 days max. I toughed through it, and was fortunately cured by the time of the Florida State football game so I could attend. However, later that week I was afflicted with an extremely sore throat, and I began coughing uncontrollably for the next two weeks or so. Once the coughing subsided, I thought I was finally done with this mess, but then I began having pain in my throat while swallowing for another two weeks, which made it very difficult to eat once again.</p>
        <p>Finally, after about five weeks of dealing with three separate throat/mouth related problems in a row, I was cured once my extremely sore throat went away. Putting it robotically, this was a failure of the body’s “throat and mouth subsystem.” So, do I appreciate being able to eat now more than I did before, after being unable to eat normally for over a month? I’d say, as usual, it is complicated, and neither extremely answer here is correct. If I am in a good mood, I would say I do, and if I am in a worse mood, I just don’t think about it at all. The moral here is to not take what you have for granted. How cliché.</p>

        <h2>The Offensive Subsystem</h2>
        <p>Joni Mitchell’s 1970 song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2595abcvh2M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Yellow Taxi</a>” has the relevant line in its chorus, “Don’t it always seem to go, that you don’t know what you got ‘till it’s gone?” Counting Crow’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvtJPs8IDgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more well-known</a> cover of the song changes the overall meaning of the song, but this key lyric holds true. People tend to not appreciate, or even notice, the more mundane subsystems in their lives until they suddenly do not work. The previous throat issues I discussed is one example of this effect, but there are two more recent examples that made me think of this trend. Cloudflare’s downtime earlier caused many critical websites, such as ChatGPT, to go down for a substantial amount of time. This caused many complaints by AI addicts, who suddenly had to figure out how to use this newly discovered form of intelligence called “a brain.” Most people do not realize how many dependencies websites and other online systems have, and how fragile the entire Internet really can be. I would not say there is a single point of failure for the whole Internet, but we are certainly getting close to that point.</p>
        <p>Finally, let’s get a bit less abstract and talk football. The football graybeards of the world will often give anecdotes along the lines of, “The job of an offensive line is to never be talked about.” There is a reason why it is a tradition in the NFL for quarterbacks to buy their offensive linemen expensive gifts such as watches and cars. When an offensive line does its job, it allows the team to make exciting plays, and most casual fans will not even think about how great of a job the line is doing. The only time the average football fan notices the offensive line is either when there is a sack, or when there is a holding penalty. I would say it is a tragedy how underappreciated these guys are, they are still getting paid millions of dollars, so I cannot say I feel too bad. It seems some subsystems, from the human body to the offensive line, work best when we do not think about them at all.</p>
