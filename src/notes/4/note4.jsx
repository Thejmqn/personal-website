        <h2>Is it really the best we can do?</h2>
        <p>The Star-Spangled Banner, as the national anthem, is a profoundly important song to the national culture of America. It is known and held dear by virtually every American. It is played at patriotic celebrations and before the start of almost every professional sporting event. With how prominent it is, to imagine a different national anthem sounds almost un-American and un-patriotic. But to be honest, I just do not think the national anthem is that good as a nation-encompassing tune. I know that in today’s day and age it can be seen as radical and unamerican to criticize a symbol as beloved and patriotic as the Star-Spangled Banner. But for the sake of argument, let’s consider some of the problems with the national anthem, and some other patriotic songs that could replace it.</p>
        <p>The problems with the anthem are twofold, with the first problem lying in the lyrics. As we all know, the anthem was written by Francis Scott Key while captured aboard a British ship during the War of 1812\. The problem is, the anthem is so specifically tied to this one event and to the flag. America has 250 years of history and millions of acres of landmarks that our national anthem could reference. Instead, the national anthem solely discusses a single day in a single battle in one of America’s most obscure wars. It also only focuses on the flag instead of the hundreds of other important American symbols that are now in our culture. A good national anthem needs to be more expansive in referencing American history, landscape, and culture.</p>
        <p>The second problem, which is slightly more subjective, is the anthem’s musical composition. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdl8p9akJJw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vox discusses in a great video</a>, the national anthem is surprisingly difficult for the average American to sing. The anthem’s range is over an octave and a half, and there are whole octave jumps present in the song. This is far beyond what the average, untrained American can sing. The lyrics themselves are also quite confusingly arranged, and not in line with modern English. I bet that at least half of Americans would not be unable to identify what “O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?” actually means. All of this can lead to embarrassing scenarios where a National Anthem singer at a sporting event forgets the words or completely fails at singing it. An alternative anthem could solve all of these problems.</p>

        <h2>The Anthem Criteria</h2>
        <p>To narrow down the search for the next anthem, some criteria need to be established. There are hundreds of possible songs that theoretically could be suggested, but I would say there are only about 25 good choices at most. I have come up with five criteria that all candidates must fulfill to be considered.</p>
        <ol className="note-list">
            <li className="list-element">Most obviously, the song should relate to America in some way. This can be by discussing American culture, pride, traditions, landscape, the flag, or anything else distinctly American. The word “America” does not need to be explicitly mentioned, as long as it is directly discussing the U.S.A. I do not think this needs much of an explanation.</li>
            <li className="list-element">Approximately 50% or more of adult Americans should be aware of the song’s existence. They do not have to know all or even any of the words, but they should at least be familiar enough with the tune to know it is related to America. While there are likely hundreds of patriotic songs that could be good choices, if no one has heard it already it is not the best fit. Most people do not want to spend too much time learning a new song.</li>
            <li className="list-element">The song must have words and be reasonably singable. While there are some national anthems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcha_Real" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as Spain's</a>, which do not have any words, I do not believe this would work in the U.S.’s case. This disqualifies any purely instrumental tunes, even if they are patriotic, such as the “1812 Overture”. Also, some pieces like Stars and Stripes Forever technically have lyrics, but are almost never performed with singers, so they will be ignored as well.</li>
            <li className="list-element">The song cannot already be tied or heavily related to any sort of organization, group of people, or object, other than the U.S. at large. For example, “The Caissons Go Rolling Along” is ineligible as it is identified with the Army, and “Hail to the Chief” is ineligible as it is tied to the President. The only exception to this rule is songs that relate to the flag, since the current national anthem is already tied to the flag.</li>
            <li className="list-element">The song, or a distinct part of it, should be able to be sung comfortably in under 2 minutes. The song itself can be under 2 minutes, or certain verses should be able to be picked out. If there are no distinct verses in a long song, it is ineligible.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Great Choices</h2>
        <h3> Number 1: America the Beautiful</h3>
        <p>Written in 1893 by Katharine Bates, the most often suggested song to become the new national anthem is “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0P7xr7NDAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">America the Beautiful</a>”, and for good reason. It describes not only the landscape of America, from coast to coast, but also the history of America, and the struggles it has faced and overcome. It ends by discussing the promising future of tomorrow. The song is easy to sing, can be divided into one or two verses to sing before events, and its words are already known by many Americans. It has already been sung <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hptioYZXFeU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before the Super Bowl</a>, and has had many unique renditions showcasing American culture. This ranges from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FXN1Z6Q004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray Charles's soul version</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxq_5cFEb0Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan Jackson's country version</a>. If the national anthem were to be replaced, this would most likely be the tune that takes its spot. And in my opinion, it is much more descriptive of America and its current state than the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
        <h3> Number 2: God Bless America</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z5hD38Bs8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God Bless America</a> takes the spot as the second best candidate to replace the national anthem. It was written during World War I by Irving Berlin, who also wrote many famous songs such as “White Christmas” and “There’s no Business Like Show Business”. Berlin himself encompasses the American Dream. He was born in Russian to a poor Jewish family, before moving to New York City and finding songwriting success. The song describes American scenery and asks for guidance from the Heavens to protect America in the future. Like America the Beautiful, it is short, easy to sing, and most Americans already know the lyrics. It is already performed before some NHL games and during all New York Yankees games. Famous performances include those by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAXHr0qccvE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generald Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmc-pEyUHTs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irving Berlin, the author himself.</a> The only thing that holds it back from number 1 is that it is a bit short in length, and some may object to its slightly religious nature.</p>
        <h3> Number 3: Battle Hymn of the Republic</h3>
        <p>I might be a bit biased with this one, but at the number three spot I have the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAqNe-m0a8s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>. Written during the Civil War by Julia Ward Howe, the song takes inspiration from and expands the concepts of the abolitionist hymn “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown%27s_Body" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Brown's Body</a>”. The Battle Hymn describes the fight of the union against slavery and the Biblically destined ideas of freedom and equality for all. It includes the famous lyric “Glory, glory, hallelujah\!” and has been adapted into a whole range of other tunes, from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNq0qmR1kdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fight Song of the University of Georgia</a> to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWgsdexkv18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paratrooper's theme</a>. Its lyrics are honestly epic and the best of any on this list. However, its intensely violent and religious imagery is objected to by some groups, so it may not be the best choice as a nation-encompassing national anthem.</p>
        <h3> Number 4: This Land is Your Land</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most misunderstood song in the entirety of American musical history is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWgsdexkv18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Land is Your Land</a>, which is at the number four spot. Most people know it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_A-7Pespg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a version like this one</a>, just one of the patriotic songs they were forced to learn in fourth grade. However, the original version is actually a critique of American capitalism and wealth inequality. The tune was written in 1940 by folk singer Woodie Guthrie in response to the overplaying of God Bless America. The original version contains lyrics such as “By the relief office I seen my people; As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking: Is this land made for you and me?” However, these lyrics are cut from most renditions today. The song is catchy and known by most Americans already, and in my opinion is a great choice, regardless of which verses are included.</p>
        <h3> Number 5: My Country ‘Tis of Thee</h3>
        <p>The final song that I consider to be a great choice for the national anthem is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqiOBbRzEgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Country 'Tis of Thee</a>, at the number five spot. Written in 1831 by Samuel Francis Smith, the song describes the history of America up to that point and the nation’s hope for a bright and free future. The song was the de facto national anthem until 1931, when Congress officially designated the Star-Spangled Banner as the national anthem. The tune is famous, easy to sing, and short, which makes it seem like it would be the number one choice. However, the melody is set to the same tune as “God Save the King”, the UK national anthem, which I find to be an almost-dealbreaker. One of the most famous performances is by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=034fNYyY9HU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Clarkson before the 2013 inauguration</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Average and Fun Choices</h2>
        <p>The five songs I listed are the five songs that I firmly believe would be better choices for the national anthem than the Star-Spangled Banner. However, there are some other songs that fit the criteria that I mentioned above, so I feel obligated to mention them. Some of these choices are serious, while some of them are just for fun (although some people might have the fun ones at their number one spot, which I respect).</p>
        <p>At number 6 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCoYDxytsG4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God Bless the U.S.A</a>. Written by Lee Greenwood, the song is an example of a more modern patriotic song that has become quite popular and famous. It highlights the author’s gratitude towards being born in America, and how if he had to start anew he would still choose to live in America. In recent years, the song has become associated with Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, being played before many Trump rallies.</p>
        <p>At number 7 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEAGqljVD2U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is My Country</a>, which is a great tune and poem describing the diversity of America and the pride all Americans feel, whether American by birth or naturalization. It is inspiring and easy to sing, but it is probably the least well-known of any song of this list, which holds it back substantially. Number 8 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73Qs0_Flkhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youre' a Grand Old Flag</a>, which is also an acceptable and well-known choice. However, I am not sure why we would replace the national anthem for one song about the flag with another song about the flag.</p>
        <p>Bridging the gap between serious choices and joke choices, at number 9 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65SCziAGthw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yankee Doodle</a>. The song is from the revolutionary war and one of the first ever American songs. However, today it is known mostly as a children’s song, and some people would probably be embarrassed singing it. Despite this fact, it has some fun lyrics, such as describing the revolution as a new gun. “It made a noise like fathers gun. Only a nation louder\!”</p>
        <p>Coming in at number 10 and first on the list of joke songs is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Party in the U.S.A.</a> by Miley Cyrus. Honestly, this might be the single most popular song on this entire list, and for good reason. It is quite catchy, and I unironically do not think it would be a terrible choice for the national anthem.</p>
